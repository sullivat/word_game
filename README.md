# word_game
My implementation of the MIT 6001x word game

Requires python 3

###To play, in your terminal, run either:
`$ python3 solo_words.py`
  for a solo word game

`$ python3 comp_words.py`
  for a game that allows the option to have the computer play the hand instead

The computer follows an optimal choosing strategy and maximizes it's score, based on the hand available and the word list. The best outcome is to tie the computer's score.
